## Submission Instructions

### Overview
In this project, I want to implement information that represents the proportion of people in the United States that have bachelor's degrees, separated by county for each state. It will display a dynamic map of the US that will visually represent the proportion of adults with a degree in each state's county both by a colored choropleth map as well as having a descriptive tooltip pop up as the user hovers over each county.
### Features
- __Visualizing info__ - Users can view the proportion of degreed adults in each county by a colored map, the colors of which will be represented by a key.
- __Dynamic tooltips__ - Users can see which county they choose by hovering their cursor over a colored region. The tooltip will have text-based information about the percentage of degreed adults as well as identify the county and state it is representing.
- __Search__ - Users can search for a state or a county to return a list of related results.
- __State Page__ - Users can see a larger page of a certain state, perhaps containing a little more information.
- __Color Picker__ - Just for fun, the user can pick what color scheme they want the map to be.
